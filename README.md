# Content-Management-System-Template
This is an example Content Management System Template via Full-Stack Development! 

Greetings all! 

This is an example of a Content Management System for full-stack software engineering 
projects! I laid the foundational template to demonstrate how a basic RESTful/Fast API
is developed! 

The modules required for this to work is as follows:

    pip install Flask
    pip install render_template
    pip install request
    pip install redirect
    pip install url_for
    pip install flask_sqlalchemy
    pip install SQLAlchemy

Hapy Coding guys!
